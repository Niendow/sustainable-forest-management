Technology and forest management:

1. **Drones**: Drones can be used to monitor forests and detect changes in vegetation, which can help identify areas that need attention. They can also be used to map forest areas and monitor wildlife populations.

2. **Satellite imagery**: Satellite imagery can be used to monitor deforestation and forest degradation, and to track changes in forest cover over time. This information can be used to develop strategies for forest conservation and management.

3. **Artificial intelligence**: AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be visible to the human eye. This can help identify areas that are at risk of deforestation or forest degradation, and help develop strategies to prevent these issues.

4. **Mobile apps**: Mobile apps can be used to collect data on forest conditions, such as tree density, soil moisture, and wildlife populations. This information can be used to develop strategies for forest conservation and management.

5. **Smart sensors**: Smart sensors can be used to monitor forest conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. This information can be used to develop strategies for forest conservation and management.

6. **Blockchain**: Blockchain can be used to track the origin of wood products and ensure that they are sustainably sourced. This can help prevent illegal logging and promote sustainable forest management.
